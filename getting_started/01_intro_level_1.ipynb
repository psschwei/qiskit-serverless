    "We will start with writing code for our program and saving it to [./source_files/gs_level_1.py](./source_files/gs_level_1.py) file. Our program will be a Qiskit hello world example, which prepares a Bell state and then returns the measured probability distribution\n",

    "Next we need to run this program. For that we need to import necessary classes and configure them. \n",
    "One of those classes is `QuantumServerless`, which is a client class to interact with compute resources.\n",
    "It will help us run programs, monitor progress and fetch results.\n",
    "\n",
    "`QuantumServerless` accepts `Provider` as a constructor argument. Provider stores configuration where our compute resources are and how to connect to them. For this example we will be using provider which is connected to local docker-compose setup. For more information on docker-compose check out [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), but for now you can think of it as your local environment manager. So, in this example programs will be running locally on your machine. If you want to run it elsewhere, you need to provide corresponding host and authentication details."
