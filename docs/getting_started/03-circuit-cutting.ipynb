    "# Tutorial 3: Circuit Cutting with Quantum Serverless\n",
    "\n",
    "**Circuit cutting** is a technique to decompose a quantum circuit into smaller circuits, whose results can be knitted together to reconstruct the original circuit output. \n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit knitting toolbox implements a wire cutting method presented in [CutQC](https://doi.org/10.1145/3445814.3446758) (Tang et al.). This method allows a circuit wire to be cut such that the generated subcircuits are amended by measurements in the Pauli bases and by state preparation of four Pauli eigenstates (see Fig. 4 of [CutQC](https://doi.org/10.1145/3445814.3446758)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This wire cutting technique is comprised of the following basic steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decompose**: Cut a circuit into multiple subcircuits. Here, we'll use an automatic method to find optimal cut(s). See [tutorial 2](tutorial_2_manual_cutting.ipynb) to manually cut a circuit.\n",
    "2. **Evaluate**: Execute those subcircuits on quantum backend(s).\n",
    "3. **Reconstruct**: Knit the subcircuit results together to reconstruct the original circuit output (in this case, the full probability distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Quantum Serverless**](https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/quantum-serverless) is a platform built to enable distributed computing across a variety of classical and quantum backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will show how to use quantum serverless to run portions of this workflow on a remote cluster."
